- beats:
  - test code for harmonic, linear, geometric, etc plus tests
    going from beats=>seconds, seconds=>beats, beats=>beat-periods.
  - beats_linear should be made into beats linear;
    support for harmonic and geometric.
- BUG: why are there extra dots on the bottom for
  the main display when ./bb-analyze example-scripts/test-bow
- particle system:
  - grain-instrument parameters should filter out too,
    instead of needing to explicitly define them.
  - figure out why envelope of grain0==grain1 is so much
    shorter than expected (hint: probably the noise gets filtered to its average quickly).
  - perhaps the noise should have its average (after enveloping) subtracted.
  - random_instrument: discrete distribution of instruments
    - define subparameter semantics
      - just like any container
- brownian motion instrument
- defined-by-points bezier waveforms for enveloping
- documentation of the score-string format would be nice
- finish: way to start playing at non-first-beat
  - need to actual use the note filters in 'render'
  - need command-line options:
    --{start,end}-{beat,part,mark}=VALUE
    --guess-{start,end}-time
    --max-note-length=SECONDS
    (these need to add note-filters and set the start/end times)
- fix fm_drum
- random chord generator to use as a baseline
- <autoduration=1> for legato
- other param tweaks:
  - noise_filterer::falloff should be halflife_time [XXX: this is pretty confusing]

more ridiculous:
- proper instrument classes, instead of 'data' and 'free_data'
- some way to represent (1/duration) as a param (ie a unit of frequency)
- BbPrograms could be optionally able to tell input and output types
- get rid of "parts"; strings should be able to change instruments.
- non-lazy function invocation
- casting?
  - would need to be in bb_function_choose()
    and anyone that uses it (right now, just lazy functions)
- eliminate special, in favor of stack-frames (bb_vm_push_stack etc)

write to stk authors:
 - ModalBar does not use "mode volumes": they are overwritten by setStrikePosition()

portability?
 - do we care?
 - log2 is used here-and-there.
